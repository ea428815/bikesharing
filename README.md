### Bikesharing
### Bikesharing Overview
#### After visiting New York City, a pair of entrepreneurs became enticed by the bikesharing business they witnessed and utilized. Upon returning home, they began exploring the feasibility of creating such business in their hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. The pair used data from the company Citi Bike to explore the success and overall functioning of Citi Bike in New York City. The data was originally formatted in a csv file, but the pair wanted to transform the data to better visualize different aspects of Citi Bike. Several visualizations were created in Tableau to share the data with investors in an interesting and easy to read format.

## Bikesharing Summary
Based on the visualizations created the majority of bike trips last less than 30 minutes. Additionally, males comprise the majority of Citi Bike users as indicated in the trip duration breakdown by gender as well as the gender and startime/stoptime. Most users of Citi Bike services are from subscribers, which indicates that users find value in multiple trips through Citi Bike as opposed to single use customers. As New York City is a large tourist destination, customers might be more prevalent as tourists may not need a long-term subscription. For the entrepreneurs in Des Moines, they can surmise that subscribers would also make up most of their business.


Every day of the week has times of increased popularity, however weekdays in the morning and the evening have the highest spike in business. For consumers in Des Moines, Citi Bike could offer an alternative to driving for work commuters. The visualization for popular starting points indicates that Citi Bike stations placed near busy locations in Des Moines could be very profitable. Further visualizations that could benefit the entrepreneurs could include one that looks at the age and gender of users and another one to show the user type breakdown by gender. Looking at these aspects can highlight discrepancies between the gender, age, and usage of Citi Bike and inform the entrepreneurs about how to better engage underserved people.
